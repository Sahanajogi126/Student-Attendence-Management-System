The Student Attendance Management System is designed to simplify and automate the process of recording daily attendance in educational institutions. 
Instead of relying on manual registers, the system provides an easy-to-use interface for faculty to select their class, view the list of students,
and mark each student as present or absent. All attendance data is securely stored in a centralized database, ensuring accuracy, preventing data loss,
and saving valuable time for teachers.
The system also enables students and administrators to access real-time attendance information through a dedicated dashboard. Students can view their 
attendance percentage for each subject, while faculty and administrators can generate daily and monthly attendance reports with a single click. By offering automation, transparency, and efficiency, this module enhances the overall academic management process and helps maintain accurate records that support decision-making and academic tracking.
